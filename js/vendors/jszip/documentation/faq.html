<p>If you are sure that the zip file is correct, that error often comes from a
corrupted content. An ajax request, if not prepared correctly, will try to
decode the binary content as a text and corrupt it. See
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/documentation/howto/read_zip.html">this page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="my-browser-crashes-becomes-unresponsive-never-finish-the-execution">My browser crashes / becomes unresponsive / never finish the execution</h3>
<p>That happens if you try to handle to much data. If possible, try again with a
small (some KB) zip file to see if your code is correct. See
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/documentation/limitations.html">this page</a> for more
informations.</p>
